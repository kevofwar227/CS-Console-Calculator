# CS-Console-Calculator
This is a very simple console calculator made with C sharp. I wouldn't mind people making edits to see how cool we can make this basic calculator.

A few notes:
1) these are the files from visual studio. In order to work on them and view them you will need to download/install visual studio and add the folder to your repos folder.
2) The code was written in C# using Visual Studio 2019 on a Windows 10 PC.
3)It may take a bit before your changes will be committed between other projects, my personal time, and reviewing/testing the code

All this being said I created a basic calculator console app so feel free to edit it to make it better and cooler. some ideas can include: more operations, cleaning up the code, etc. Either way this is just a cool little project i threw together since i started learning C#.


thanks,
    Kevin
